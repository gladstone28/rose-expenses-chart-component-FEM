## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current dayâ€™s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources-2

- [MDN - Working with JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) - I learned to worked with **JSON** before, but I had got help on how to remember a few things, and everything I needed was in this article.
- [Stack Overflow - I learned how I can change the thickness of my `<hr>` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4151743/how-can-i-change-the-thickness-of-my-hr-tag) - The `hr` element has some strange behaviour, and the answers to this question helped me deal with that.
- [MDN - Window: resize event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event) - When I tried using `transform` to scale my design, I realized I had to use **JavaScript** because the `calc` function cannot divide two lengths. I was inspired on how to use this article to help me use the resize event to get the needed results.
- [MDN - Using data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes) - I learned how to use data attributes to send the data from the JSON file to the HTML code. It was my first time doing this, and this article helped me understand how to develop a simple solution.
